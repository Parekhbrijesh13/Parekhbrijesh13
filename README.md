I am a BCA student passionate about becoming a software developer.
Currently, I am learning Java, Python, SQL, and core programming concepts to build a strong foundation in software development.

I enjoy creating small projects, understanding how things work behind the scenes, and improving my logic through DSA. I focus on writing clean, simple, and understandable code while building my skills step by step.

Currently working on:
• Java (OOP, Collections, JDBC)
• Python basics & scripting
• SQL queries and database design
• DSA (Arrays, Strings, HashMaps)
• Mini-projects to improve practical knowledge

I am continuously learning and open to opportunities where I can grow as a developer and contribute to real-world projects.

🌱 I’m open to internship opportunities, real-world projects, and continuous learning.
